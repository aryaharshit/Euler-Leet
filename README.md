# Euler-Leet
Being a CS enthusiast I am trying to solve basic problems from Euler Project and Leetcode in order to practice scripiting and develop logic as we keep on going. 
All the problems here solved in python.
Please find seperate folders for Leetcode and Euler Project named leet and euler respectively.
The problem statements are written as docstrings, also the name of the .py file gives hint about the problem statement
